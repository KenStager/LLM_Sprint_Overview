# Clustering Strategy V3 - Quick Reference

## What's New in V3
- **Bug Fixes**: Weight normalization (1.2 → 1.0), geographic fields
- **Complete Implementation**: UnifiedClusteringService with full code
- **Code Cleanup Plan**: Reorganization and quality improvements
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, performance, quality tests
- **Monitoring**: Metrics, alerts, dashboards, health checks
- **Runbooks**: Daily ops, incident response, deployment guides

## Critical Fix Required
```python
# Fix in clustering/config/clustering_config.py
perp_name: 0.45  # was 0.50
crime_location: 0.20  # was 0.30
text_similarity: 0.05  # was 0.10
# Now sums to 1.0 correctly
```

## Architecture Solution
```
UnifiedClusteringService
├── ClusterEngine (clustering, no LLM)
├── HybridEngine (enrichment, LLM)
├── FormatAdapter (compatibility)
├── QualityAssessor (validation)
└── MetricsCollector (monitoring)
```

## Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1**: Bug fixes + unified service
- **Week 2**: Integration + monitoring  
- **Week 3**: Testing + optimization
- **Week 4**: Production deployment

## Key Benefits
- Leverages both engines optimally
- Controls API costs (<$5/day)
- Prevents duplicate clusters
- Provides rich case summaries
- Full operational support

## Next Steps
1. Review full V3 strategy document
2. Fix weight configuration bug
3. Run clustering on 169 articles
4. Begin unified service implementation
