# LLM-Guided Development Process: SNAPPED Pipeline Case Study

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a systematic approach to leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for production software development. Through progressive refinement and strategic documentation, we showcase how LLMs can maintain both high-level architectural perspective and deep technical implementation details simultaneously.

## 🎯 Key Innovation: Progressive Context Management

Our methodology enables LLMs to:
- **Zoom In**: Dive deep into specific technical challenges while maintaining system awareness
- **Zoom Out**: Return to architectural decisions without losing implementation details
- **Stay Aligned**: Use living documents as checkpoints to prevent scope drift
- **Deliver Results**: Move from analysis to working code through structured iterations

## 📋 Process Methodology

### 1. Initial Context Setting
We begin with comprehensive system state documentation:
```markdown
- Working Directory: /Users/kenny/Desktop/Snapped_Production/
- Database: Supabase project ahfwzfmetiqpvyzhrgxh
- Current State: 183 clusters (0 duplicates), 169 unclustered articles
- Challenge: Two incompatible clustering engines in production
```

### 2. Progressive Analysis
Rather than attempting to solve everything at once, we guide the LLM through layers:

**Layer 1: System Discovery**
- Analyze existing implementations
- Identify architectural patterns
- Document findings in structured logs

**Layer 2: Problem Identification**
- Critical bug: Weight configuration summing to 1.2 instead of 1.0
- Incompatible JSON formats between engines
- Missing multi-session support causing duplicates

**Layer 3: Solution Design**
- Unified service architecture
- Format adaptation layer
- Selective enrichment strategy

**Layer 4: Implementation Planning**
- Complete code generation (1,700+ lines)
- Testing strategies
- Deployment runbooks

### 3. Living Documentation

Each document serves a specific purpose in the LLM workflow:

### Living Documentation

Each document serves a specific purpose in the LLM workflow:

| Document | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| [`CLUSTERING_ENGINE_STRATEGY_V3.md`](https://github.com/KenStager/LLM_Sprint_Overview/blob/main/CLUSTERING_ENGINE_STRATEGY_V3.md) | Complete technical implementation (1,707 lines) | Per major change |
| [`CLUSTERING_V3_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`](https://github.com/KenStager/LLM_Sprint_Overview/blob/main/CLUSTERING_V3_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md) | Progress tracking & task management | Per task |
| [`CLUSTERING_V3_QUICK_REF.md`](https://github.com/KenStager/LLM_Sprint_Overview/blob/main/CLUSTERING_V3_QUICK_REF.md) | Executive summary & quick reference | As needed |
| [`CLUSTERING_V3_DELIVERY_OVERVIEW.md`](https://github.com/KenStager/LLM_Sprint_Overview/blob/main/CLUSTERING_V3_DELIVERY_OVERVIEW.md) | What was delivered & outcomes | End of sprint |
| [`SNAPPED Clustering Session Completion Log`](https://github.com/KenStager/LLM_Sprint_Overview/blob/main/SNAPPED%20Clustering%20Session%20Completion%20Log.md) | Work record & technical achievements | End of session |
| [`SNAPPED Clustering Continuation Prompt`](https://github.com/KenStager/LLM_Sprint_Overview/blob/main/SNAPPED%20Clustering%20Continuation%20Prompt.md) | Enable seamless session handoffs | Start of new session |

## 🔧 Technical Achievements

### Problem Solved
Unified two incompatible clustering engines while:
- Maintaining zero duplicate clusters
- Controlling API costs to <$5/day
- Preserving multi-session support
- Enabling selective LLM enrichment

### Code Delivered
```
├── UnifiedClusteringService (400+ lines)
├── FormatAdapter (150+ lines)
├── QualityAssessor (200+ lines)
├── MetricsCollector (300+ lines)
├── Comprehensive Tests (500+ lines)
└── Operational Runbooks (10 documents)
```

### Architecture Pattern
```python
# Elegant solution leveraging both engines optimally
class UnifiedClusteringService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cluster_engine = ClusterEngine()      # For clustering (no API cost)
        self.hybrid_engine = HybridEngine()        # For enrichment (selective)
        self.format_adapter = FormatAdapter()      # For compatibility
```

## 📈 Process Benefits

- Comprehensive testing and deployment strategies

## 🚀 Continuation Strategy

Our continuation prompt demonstrates how to:

1. **Preserve State**: Exact system configuration and progress
2. **Highlight Priorities**: Critical bugs requiring immediate attention
3. **Provide Context**: All necessary files and their purposes
4. **Enable Action**: Specific commands and implementation steps

Example from our continuation prompt:
```markdown
## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Fix

### 1. Weight Configuration Bug
The similarity weights sum to 1.2 instead of 1.0:
[specific code and fix provided]

### 2. Immediate Tasks
1. Fix weight configuration bug
2. Run clustering on 169 articles
3. Begin implementing UnifiedClusteringService
```

## 💡 Key Insights for LLM Development

### Do's
- ✅ Create living documents that evolve with the project
