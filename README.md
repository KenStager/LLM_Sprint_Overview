# LLM-Guided Development Process: SNAPPED Pipeline Case Study

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a structured and powerful approach to leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid, production-ready software development—highlighting progressive refinement, strategic documentation, and the ability to maintain both high-level architectural oversight and detailed technical implementations simultaneously.

## Core Innovation: Progressive Context Management

Our demonstrated process showcases how, by carefully orchestrating LLM interactions, complex projects that would typically require weeks of team effort can be effectively completed in significantly shorter timelines:

* **Zoom In**: Precisely address specific technical challenges without sacrificing the broader system context.
* **Zoom Out**: Fluidly transition back to architectural discussions without losing essential detail.
* **Stay Aligned**: Continuously reference living documentation, ensuring clarity and maintaining project scope.
* **Deliver Results**: Move swiftly from conceptual analysis to deployment-ready solutions.

## Methodological Process

### 1. Initial Context Setting

We begin by thoroughly documenting the project's current state to facilitate rapid progress:

```markdown
- Working Directory: /Users/kenny/Desktop/Snapped_Production/
- Database: Supabase project ahfwzfmetiqpvyzhrgxh
- Current State: 183 clusters (0 duplicates), 169 unclustered articles
- Immediate Challenge: Integrating two previously incompatible clustering engines
```

### 2. Progressive Problem-Solving

This structured approach efficiently addresses problems traditionally tackled by entire teams:

**Layer 1: Discovery**

* Quickly perform detailed analysis of existing implementations
* Clearly identify architectural patterns for immediate actionable insights

**Layer 2: Problem Identification**

* Prompt identification of critical issues (e.g., weight configuration discrepancies, JSON incompatibilities)
* Ensure clarity on challenges like missing multi-session support to avoid future duplication

**Layer 3: Solution Architecture**

* Develop a unified service architecture swiftly
* Seamlessly integrate format adapters
* Precisely control selective data enrichment to minimize costs

**Layer 4: Implementation & Testing**

* Rapidly generate robust code (1,700+ lines) within highly accelerated timelines
* Guarantee full test coverage for immediate production readiness
* Provide deployment guidelines and comprehensive operational runbooks

### 3. Purposeful Documentation

Living documentation ensures ongoing clarity and alignment, enabling rapid progression without traditional delays:
